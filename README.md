# Resume Screening & Job Recommendation System

A full-stack web application that analyzes resumes and recommends relevant job roles using NLP-based similarity matching.

---

## Overview

This project automates the initial resume screening process by extracting resume content, preprocessing it using natural language processing techniques, and matching it against job descriptions stored in a database. The system ranks job roles based on relevance and displays the results through a simple web interface.
